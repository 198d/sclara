Sclara
======

Sclara is a lightweight testing DSL written in Python. It makes heavy
use of context managers to describe and define test cases while allowing
the developer to focus on describing the system under test rather than
on writing complicated OO class-based test cases that unittest
encourages. It is similar to other projects such as konira and lettuce,
however, tests are written in pure Python and can be run with the Python
interpreter directly.

Started as a simple comment made to a friend at the 2012 PyCon TiP BoF:
'How about an RSpec clone written entirely with context managers'. The
name is a mangling of the location of PyCon that year: s(anta)clara.
